Notes:

If swap proportion was too low it would create twins that would force the data to a single genetic make up.
I increased the swapping chance, but sometimes it would still converge. Could be a problem with small sample size.
I added random mutations to combat this.

I didnt like just selecting the top half best genes. It would force convergence. I opted for PMX to allow for sub-optimal genes to continue

Incude shuffling for random mating between offspring
Forces individuals that went broke to die by making their worth 0.

Sick of single-action-substitutions causing convergence and twins. I opted for single-point mutation
